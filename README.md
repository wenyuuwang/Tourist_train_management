# Tourist_train_management

## Purpose and requirement

The purpose of the required journey management system is to manage tourist trains that are serving a number of routes on the new area. 

The system manages the allocation of trains to journeys and tracks their progress along the routes. 

Each route is served by a timetable, which states the times at which a train will depart from designated train stops along the route. 

A single outward and return trip on the timetable is known as a journey. 

Each route may be served by a number of trains, but only one train is assigned to a particular journey at a time. 

Drivers are assigned to journeys when they are available.
